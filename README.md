- **BB:** Example on the transmission of a baseband signal.
- **AM:** Example on the transmission of an amplitude-modulated signal.
- **FM:** Example on the transmission of a frequency modulated signal.
- **PWM:** Example on the transmission of a pulse-width modulated signal.
- **FM-Receiver:** Example using the HackRF card for the reception of a commercial FM signal.
- **FM-Transmiter:** Example using the HackRF card to broadcast a commercial FM signal.
